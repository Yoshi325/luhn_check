# luhn_check

This program will allow you to verify if a credit card number is valid by utilizing the Luhn algorithm. It will allow you to import a list (csv format) or enter a number manually. It also allows you to save the results if you are using a list. The output meets PCI DSS by only showing the first six and last four numbers of the results, masking the middle numbers.
